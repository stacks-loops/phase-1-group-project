We are using the Jambase API to create a single page application where
users will be able to select a concert from a dropdown menu and view the
info about the concert, as well as like and comment

Three attributes we will show are
Image - from db.json
Artist - from API
Venue - API
Genre - API

We also have an audio control that plays on command.

There will be an upvote button section that persists
